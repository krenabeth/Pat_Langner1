	<p>Pat enjoys painting with acryclic paint on masonite. Growing up on a small farm in Virginia influenced Pat's choice of subject for her artwork. She painted with oils in the early years - starting when 12, through about 15 years. She got tired of the smell of oils. She took private art lessons in high school, took many art classes in college at Bridgewater, and continued to learn post-college through community education. Pat started to paint miniatures in 1980. For these small paintings - sometimes as small as 1 inch by 1 inch - she favors masonite with acrylic paints. An active member of the <a href="http://www.farmingtonartfoundation.org">Farmington Art Foundation</a> in Farmington, Michigan, Pat teaches and volunteers her time bringing art into the lives of community members.</p>
